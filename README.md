# Welcome to RoomCraft!

We all are the main characters of our own stories. And we deserve a strong arsenal of tools to accompany us on our hero’s journey.

Introducing: RoomCraft which uses gamification to help you be the most productive version of yourself, so you can slay the dragons of your life.

Picture this: Your virtual room is a dynamic landscape, featuring sections tailored to your needs. Take class notes, update your todo-list, and study with a pomodoro timer, all on the same website. 

But RoomCraft is not just a solitary journey; just like in every adventure, you meet a wide array of friends along the way. Exchange notes and messages to your friends through the notebook feature and showcase your achievements on a leaderboard based on exp earned from completing todo-list items. Gain more achievements so that you can unlock more chapters in your very own hero's tale.

Whether you're facing academic challenges, work projects, or personal goals, RoomCraft motivates you to be the most productive version of yourself. It's time to slay the dragons of procrastination, disorganization, and inefficiency. So what are you waiting for? Your journey begins now with RoomCraft!
